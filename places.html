                            <p>Nowadays, the Gateway of India is one of the most popular gathering spots in Mumbai for tourists and locals alike. Watch the yachts and ferries take off to sea from the five jetties that flank the arch. Enjoy some of the famous bhelpuri (a crunchy, savory snack made of puffed rice and doused in tamarind sauce) from the street food vendors. Or just spend an hour or two people watching at this lively attraction.

                            <p>No trip to Mumbai would be complete without a cruise down Marine Drive. The 3.6-kilometer-long, C-shaped boulevard offers epic views of the coast. However, just as amazing are the sightseeing opportunities on the other side of Marine Drive. The street is lined with stunning Art Deco buildings that have earned status as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

                            <p>One of Mumbai's most iconic sites is a cable-stayed bridge known as the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. Opened in 2009, the eight-lane bridge connects the central business district with the western suburbs over the open sea, offering some much-needed relief from the congestion on the Mahim Causeway. It has become the Mumbai equivalent of New York's Brooklyn Bridge or Sydney's Opera House.
